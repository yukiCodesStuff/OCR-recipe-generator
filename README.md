This will be an improvised version of the one used for the TAMU HowdyHack 2022 competition [https://devpost.com/software/aggie-grocer] (Winner)

This project will use Spring Boot for the Backend, Frontend is still TBD but will most likely use React as that is something I have been meaning to play with.
